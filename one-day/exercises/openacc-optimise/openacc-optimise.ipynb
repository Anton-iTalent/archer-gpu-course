Now use a data construct which encompasses the whole main loop to avoid all unnecessary copies, and test. If time is still much slower that the CPU, it is due to the data copies at the very start and very end of the main loop. A more realistic simulation will have many, many more iterations, so these copy times will become insignificant. Edit the code to ensure that the timing statements are inside the data region, i.e. these transfers are excluded from the timings, and test again. You will find that the GPU code is now much faster than the CPU."
